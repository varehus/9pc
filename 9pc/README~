9P for C#

This is a Monodevelop project directoy you can copy into ~/Projects
and just build from inside Monodevelop. It contains a rudimentary
implementation of the 9P protocol of Plan 9 from Bell Labs[0] for C#.

The complete parsing of 9P packages and stat structs is implemented
and some examples can be seen in the Main() function at the end of
Main.cs. Adding functions, like doremove() or docreate() is as easy as
looking up the values you need in the manual pages of Plan 9[1].

Have fun using it,
